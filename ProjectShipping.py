# Sals Shipping Project

# build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine 
# the cheapest way to ship that package.

# This program asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of
# shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Salâ€™s Shippers.


# Variables
weight = 10

cost_drone = ""
