# LOOPS




# for Loops 
# - In a for loop, we will know in advance how many times the loop will 
# need to iterate because we will be working on a collection with a predefined length. 
# With for loops, on each iteration, we will be able to perform an action on each 
# element of the collection.

# for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
# <action>

# A for keyword indicates the start of a for loop.
# A <temporary variable> that is used to represent the value of the element in the 
# collection the loop is currently on.
# An in keyword separates the temporary variable from the collection used for iteration.
# A <collection> to loop over. In our examples, we will be using a list.
# An <action> to do anything on each iteration of the loop.


ingredients = ["milk", "sugar", "vanilla extract", "dough", "chocolate"]
for ingredient in ingredients:
    print(ingredient)
# A temporary variableâ€™s name is arbitrary and does not need to be defined beforehand. 
# Both of the following code snippets do the exact same thing as our above example:
for i in ingredients:
    print(i)
for item in ingredients:
    print(item)

# for Loop + range 
promise = "I will finish the python loops module!"

for i in range(5):
  print(promise + str(i + 1))

cache_note = "This cache contains: "
for i in range(3):
    print(cache_note,  str(i + 1), str("coins!"))
    # or (i like f strings)
    print(cache_note, f"{i + 1}", "coins!")
    
    
# while Loops
# A while loop performs a set of instructions as long as a given condition is true.

#while <conditional statement>:
#  <action>

count = 0
while count <= 3:
  # Loop Body
  print(count)
  count += 1
# count is initially defined with the value of 0. 
# The conditional statement in the while loop is count <= 3, 
# which is true at the initial iteration of the loop, so the loop body executes.
# Inside the loop body, count is printed and then incremented by 1.
# When the first iteration of the loop has finished, 
# Python returns to the top of the loop and checks the conditional again. 
# After the first iteration, count would be equal to 1 so the conditional still evaluates to True 
# and so the loop continues. 
# This continues until the count variable becomes 4. At that point, when the conditional is tested 
# it will no longer be True and the loop will stop.

coins = 0
while coins <= 4:
    print(f"You have {coins} coins!")
    # or print("You have",  str(coins),  "coins!")
    coins += 1
    print("-----") 

    # WHY THE FUCK IS IT PRINTING I HAVE 5 COINS?!?!?!
print(f"So your total is {coins}! Wow so many coins!")

length = len(python_topics)

    if n == style_1:
        print("^ I want this")
        break



# Loop Control: continue
# Similar to when we were using the break control statement,
# our continue control statement is usually paired with some form of a conditional 
# (if/elif/else).
# When a loop then encounters a continue statement it 
# immediately skips the current iteration and moves onto the next element
